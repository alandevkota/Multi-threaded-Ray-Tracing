Multi-threaded Ray Tracing

Write a ray-tracing algorithm that performs direct illumination of spheres.

Your code will take two text files as input, describing a (a) list of spheres and a (b) list of lights.
Your code will output the ray-traced image as a Targa file (source code is provided to save this file format).
Parallelize the code using the C++ std::thread library.
